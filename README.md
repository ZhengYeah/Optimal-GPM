Code for paper: [PETS'25] Optimal Piecewise-based Mechanism for Collecting Bounded Numerical Data under Local Differential Privacy

**Contributions:** 

* The first work to study the optimality of the piecewise-based mechanism under its most general form.
* The closed-form optimal mechanisms for classical domains and circular domains.

## Code Structure

We encode the solving of the optimal $m$-piece mechanism under a distance metric as a *bilinear* optimization problem and solve it using the Gurobi solver.
The solving class for each distance metric can be found in the `src` folder.
Now we support the following distance metrics:
- $L_1$ distance (absolute error)
- $L_2$ distance (squared error)
- Wasserstein distance (a distribution distance, not used in the paper)

The main folders and files are as follows:

```
|- src (solving classes for different distance metrics and other mechanisms)
|- experiments (theoretical and experimental evaluations in the paper)
|- validation (validation of the optimal mechanism)
|- reproduction (quick reproduction of the results in the paper)
```

## Reproduction 

**Install UV package manager.**
This project is packaged by `uv`, a modern Python package management system similar to `miniconda` or `poetry`.
All dependencies are listed in `pyproject.toml`.
We recommend using `uv` to create a virtual environment and install the dependencies.

To install `uv`, follow the instructions in the "[uv installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)".

After installation, follow the prompts to add `uv` to your system's `PATH`.
You can verify the installation by running the following command in your terminal (Windows, Linux, or macOS):

```
uv --version
```
This should display the installed version of `uv`.

**Install dependencies.**
After installing `uv`, cd to the project root directory and run:

```
[PROJECT_ROOT]$ uv sync
```

This command creates a virtual environment in the project root and installs the dependencies listed in `pyproject.toml`.
You can then run the provided scripts to reproduce the results in the paper. Two options are available:

### Option 1 (Quick) -- Recommended

The `reproduction` folder contains scripts  to reproduce key results from the paper. The structure is as follows:

```
|- reproduction
  |- figure_8_11.py: Figure 8a, 9a, 10a, 11b (Page 10)  (<1 minute)
  |- figure_12.py: Figure 12a and 12b (Page 11)  (<1 minute)
  |- figure_13_15.py: Figure 13a, 14, 15 (Page 11~12)  (<1 minute)
  |- figure_16_17.py: Figure 16a and 17a (Page 12)  (<10 minutes)
```
Some figures are omitted due to minor parameter differences, for brevity.

You can run these scripts directly with `uv run` (no need to manually activate the environment).
For example, to generate the first group of figures:

```
[PROJECT_ROOT]$ uv run reproduction/figure_8_11.py
```

This will display the corresponding figures using matplotlib.

### Option 2 (Detailed)

The `experiments` folder contains all scripts used in the paper, including intermediate results and full figures.
These scripts rely on PyCharmâ€™s path configuration. To run them, you need the PyCharm GUI and run them by right-clicking the script.

The scripts are organized as follows:

```
|- experiments
  |- theoretical
    |- classical_domain
      |- whole_domain_L1.py: Figure 8
      |- worst_case_L1.py, worst-case_L2.py: Figure 9
      |- comparison_truncated_and_staircase: Figure 13 and 14
      |- small_epsilon: Figure 20 in the appendix
    |- circular_domain
      |- whole_domain_circular_L2.py: Figure 10
      |- worst_case_circular_L1.py, worst-case_circular_L2.py: Figure 11
      |- comparison_purkayastha: Figure 15
    |- ablation
      |- ablation_whole_domain_L2_PM.py: Figure 12(a)
      |- ablation_whole_domain_L2_SW.py: Figure 12(b)
  |- experimental
    |- distribution_classical.py, distribution_circular.py: Figure 16
    |- mean_classical.py, mean_circular.py: Figure 17
```

The above scripts will generate `.csv` files containing the results, which are also included in corresponding folders.
Then the PDF plots can be generated by running the scripts beginning with `draw_*` in the same folder.
